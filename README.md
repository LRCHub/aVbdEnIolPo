[00:11.50] No, sir
[00:13.22] Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
[00:16.79] It's your turn, so take a seat, we're settling the final score
[00:22.56] And why do we like to hurt so much?
[00:27.52] I can't decide
[00:29.73] You have made it harder just to go on
[00:33.45] And why? All the possibilities
[00:37.50] Well, I was wrong
[00:42.81] That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[00:50.14] That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[00:57.20] I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
[01:04.74] And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[01:33.24] 
[01:22.92] I wonder
[01:25.07] How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
[01:28.41] 'Cause I burned
[01:30.33] Every bridge I ever built when you were here
[01:33.72] I still try
[01:35.93] Holding on to silly things, I never learn
[01:39.51] Oh, why? All the possibilities
[01:43.54] I'm sure you've heard
[01:48.78] That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[01:56.00] That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[02:02.98] I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
[02:10.78] That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[02:18.46] Pain, make your way to me, to me
[02:23.54] And I'll always be just so inviting
[02:29.09] If I ever start to think straight
[02:34.14] This heart will start a riot in me
[02:37.82] Let's start, start, hey
[02:39.99] Why do we like to hurt so much?
[02:45.25] Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
[02:51.22] That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[02:58.52] That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[03:05.74] That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
[03:13.08] Now I can't trust myself with anything but this
[03:20.04] And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
